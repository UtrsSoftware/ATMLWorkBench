Build Environment
   1) Windows XP SP3 or higher.
   1) Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 Version 9.0.30729.1 SP.
   2) Microsoft (R) 32-bit C/C++ Optimizing Compiler Version 15.00.30729.01 for 80x86.
   3) xerces-c-3.1.1 (statically linked).


NOTES:
   1) Change location of xerces header files (currently set to: ..\..\xerces\xerces-c-3.1.1\src)
   2) Change location of xerces library file (currently set to: ..\aixml\libs\xerces-c_static_3.lib)
   3) In file atlas_main.cpp, function "main", #define "TEST_CASES" and the include file that is associated with it, contain proprietary test information and is not included. For a successful build, no change is necessary.
   4) All the C/C++ code was written with portability in mind. Without much effort, it should be possible to port to other build environments. 
   5) Any MS-Windows APIs are only used for debug build purposes and are #ifdef/#defined within the source code.
