**ATML Workbench**


The Automatic Test Markup Language (ATML) is an IEEE family of standards
that creates a common format for the exchange of information about
Automatic Test Equipment (ATE) and test strategies. ATML is based on
eXtensible Markup Language (XML), which uses text files that are both
human- and machine-readable to exchange structured data between
applications.


Under a Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program, Universal
Technical Resource Services, Inc. (UTRS) developed the ATML Workbench, a
suite of software tools designed to support the use of ATML when
re-hosting ATLAS Test Program Sets (TPSs). The suite of tools includes:


-   The Translator Tool, which translates TPS source code from ATLAS
    into ATML. The ATML source code generated by the Translator
    specifies signal instances found in the ATLAS source using models
    drawn from a Signal Model Library.

-   The Reader Tool, extracts required test data from human-readable
    files and converts it to ATML configuration and ATE description
    files.

-   The Allocator, identifies the ATE that is capable of producing the
    signals required to execute a given TPS.


**Installation**


Installation files are available for both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows.
They can be downoaded from [https://atml.utrs.com/](https://atml.utrs.com/).


**License and Support**


The Translator, the Reader, the Allocator, the example documents
included in the download, and the ATML Workbench itself are provided as
open source under the Mozilla Public License 2.0
([https://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/](https://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/)).


In addition, UTRS developed a library of signal models designed for use
with Navy CASS TPSs. This library is available for licensing directly
from UTRS.
